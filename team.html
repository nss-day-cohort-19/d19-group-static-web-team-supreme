			<p>Born in a small village in Germany, Eliza began her apprenticeship making pocket watches at a young age. Under her Grandfather's tutelage, Eliza became the youngest master pocket watch maker at the age of 9. Her elite skills allowed her to quickly rise though the ranks, revolutionizing the design teams of multiple companies she has worked for, leading to her founding Supreme Watches in 2012.</p>

			<h3 class="title">Procuct Coordinator</h3>
			<h4 class="name">Willie Pruitt</h4>
			<p>Willie hates watches and initially felt like he was a horrible fit for the position in the company, but his ability to control the the chaotic flow between departments has been a boon. He also brings a flair to the office incorporating morale events, though some question his interest in elves and wearing of elf ears on a regular basis. Eliza welcomes the distractions and mirth.  </p>
