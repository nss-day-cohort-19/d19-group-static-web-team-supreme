				<h2>Mission</h2>
					<p>Our mission is to make you feel warm and fuzzy like a puppy. And watches definitely do that. Even though they're not fuzzy and they don't really do much to make or keep you warm. But my marketing director told me that people like puppies and warm fuzzies so that's what we're here to do for you.</p>
					<p>Puppies. Watches.</p>
					<p>Supreme Watches.</p>
					<p><a href="products.html">Buy yours today.</a></p>
					<p class="whisper">Please buy them. I need this job.</p>

				<h2>Our Promise to You</h2>
					<p>We promise to make your social life take off. The only thing holding you back from that beautiful woman or that hot guy is a really cool watch. The person that you're interested in is only interested in people with cool watches. They have no other desires, wants, concerns, or personality quirks. They only want a cool watch. And as soon as they get used to your watch and stop thinking it's so cool, you'll need a new one. And we'll be there for you.</p>
					<p>So when you need that next cool watch, <a href="products.html">Supreme Watches</a> will be there for you.</p>
